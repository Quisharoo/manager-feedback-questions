name: Functional/UI Verification

Every task response must include a verification section:

- How to run:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm start`
  - Open http://localhost:3000
- What to verify:
  - Page/URL to visit and elements/selectors to interact with (e.g., buttons in `public/index.html`, behavior driven by `public/script.js`).
  - Expected visible text, state changes, or network calls.
- If server/API changed:
  - Endpoint, example request, expected JSON.
